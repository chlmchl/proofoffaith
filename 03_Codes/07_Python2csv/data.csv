People need to listen to this and others who are talking about this we need to ban crypto we don't need it. It will only bring the planet closer to destruction and humanity closer to deeper poverty
People didn't care about children in Africa dying from mining gold and diamonds.  Now they want to be the face of justice after seeing other people profit from Bitcoin.
I hate bitcoin so much. not the product but the means to get the product and the people surrounding it/backing it.
"Come on, man... as Joe Biden would say... are these people who are bitcoin mining not using that much energy in other ways when they are not mining? This is ridiculous."
Does anyone know where there are some scholarly articles that would help with this topic of why cryptocurrency is bad for the planet?
"This is the thing that people don't understand. The energy isn't wasted, it is being converted into Money. BITCOIN is MONEY."
But why?  Why is burning electricity and doing senseless calculations making anything?  I am lost.
Many people died because of crypto like suicide or getting killed
Who thinks that the crypto bros in the comments watched the whole video and acknowledge the legitimate issue that exists?
"Nearly pure ""fallacy"" & ""sophistry"""
Its horrible and painful to think about it. Humanity's irrational greed is killing us all.
I've never heard so much Bulshit mixed in with Half-truths & Fallacies.<br>The problem is the people who buy Bitcoin. Nobody buy =loose money mining  end of.
We need a cryptocurrency that can enforce distributed ledgers without requiring the burning of power. I'd be on board then.
People need to be looking toward green energy rather than stopping technological innovation because it uses energy. Lots of things use energy.
I'd say that sending energy to what is the greatest democratization of wealth is pretty valuable.
"So basically you need a big fancy computer to get even richer?<br>I dont see how this is ""revolutionary"" if you need to be rich to get richer"
"i feel this should have also covered how bitcoin compares to the effects of traditional and physical forms of currency, feels incomplete and sort of like a hit piece otherwise."
People will be kicking themselves in few weeks if they miss the opportunity to buy and invest in bitcoin
The industrial revolution was bad for the planet
Haha people keep saying bitcoin is anti establishment. But the establishment itself control the entire market.
Crypto is the future
The people disliked are the bitcoin miners
It's much more profitable to use renewables for Bitcoin mining...<br><br>what do you think a profit motive for renewable energy will do?
This needs to go viral. People need to see the potential here. Blockchain is more than quick money as the media poses it to be.
i get 10.47% reward just for holding Algorand
I suspect people who dont have access to banks likely dont have access to a mobile/computer to have a crypto wallet
The future of Cryptocurrency lies in the hand of POS. It just needs some time to see the clarification for people.
Proof of stake is not as safe as Proof of Work.
<b>No one needs bitcoin except online criminals.</b> The best solution to bitcoins energy consumption is to shut it down. This is a serious comment. <i>No one needs bitcoin except online criminals.</i>
People will be kicking themselves in few weeks if they miss the opportunity to buy and invest in bitcoin
Lol clearly there's an agenda at work and right now they want the main public to start using crypto more and more
"Only the people that drive electric cars in their daily lives may criticize crypto and its fossil fuel consumption, and nobody else"
People will be kicking themselves in few weeks if they miss the opportunity to buy and invest in Bitcoin as it's retracing....BE WISE
I hate this. This NFT stuff should just stay away from games. And that mario kart NFT should stay in hell.

Most people venture into crypto investment to be a millionaire meanwhile I just want to be debt Free
It's cool but it's still not going to be mainstream that much. Some people will still not like parts of the blockchain except those who want to make/earn money in a different way.
Who decides 1btc = $X
But doesnt having private block chains by companies diminish the original goal of decentralization??

Wayne Dreadski music introduces people to crypto
Crypto all the way & the fact that governments hate it is proof that fiat is strictly about control of people & not about protection
"Currency is just for governments to control and collect money off people, crypto is open to everyone and is becoming a new currency not regulated by a government"
I earned this year more in crypto interest than I have my whole life using banks.<br><br>They know their days are numbered.
Bit censorship resistance sounds nice. Bitcoin won't help with censorship because the overton window is a people problem and not a financial one
Success is about focusing Your energy on what creates results and using what you already know
"Decentralization: "" Power To The People"""
If Bitcoin Fails..I wonder who are the People who Made the Paper Money off of it.
People should be in control of their futures. I vote for crypto.
Making money is the plan and with Bitcoin Investment your plans can be fulfilled.
Bitcoin is the future today i feel that Hamiltom would see it. The financial system in the country is now used to surpress the people and keep them poor. Crypto is the future Satoshi won!
A friend of mine told me he earn $2million with an invest in just seven working days how's that possible
Crypto = freedom for all people !
Bitcoin is unique & people are using it will use it & continue to use it. The point is when will bitcoin hit fever pitch levels which is inevitable......
I am the random person  <br>I love crypto 
People say he is still anonymous then who is he?
Why people care who made Bitcoin ? Can't just leave this guy be ?
The guy just confirmed CIA is behind it and people can't Want to be stripped of their God given freedoms
"well, bitcoin is like waifu. people recognize its existence yet it has no physical forms."
So essentially there is no origin story of the bitcoin currency.. i hope people soon understand its a scam
the creator was obviously a weeb and used a random japanese name. there are 160 million japanese people and this guy just happens to have that random name

I think that for us, the people, the blockchain could guarantee the imutability of the votes in an election. And the people will be able to check that everything is good, and the results are accurate.
Blockchain, Smart Contracts and Starlink are the tools in the future to decentralize everybodys lives.
The Bitcoin as peer to peer digital cash narrative didnt age well, did it?
Blockchain will come and go; it won't be around forever.
There are plenty of crypto currencies and there is no guarantees that blockchain won't be rendered obsolete at some point in time.
